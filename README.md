# Web_Scrapper_Python

This is my Python Final Project. I'm planning to make a web scrapper that applicable to all site, but it seems imposible for the code that I make.
This SC works good for site like news or blog.
It comes in three options, text/paragraph, links, and images link.
You can see the example result in try_1, try_2, and try_3.
It automatically saves the result in CSV format.
And if you'd like to use this, you need to install BeautifoulSoup4 first.
